### Projects

#### 1. Mr. Trash Wheel Ate A Lot

* **Description**: This project analyzes data from Mr. Trash Wheel, an automatic trash collector in Baltimore, Maryland. It investigates trends in trash collection over 10 years (2014-2023) and evaluates the correlation between precipitation levels and the amount of trash collected annually. The project utilizes data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques to provide insights into urban littering habits and the effectiveness of the Baltimore Healthy Harbor Initiative.
* **Technologies Used**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statistics).
* [cite_start]**Files**: `ydata_FinalProject_MrTrashWheel_Yasmina Traore.pdf` [cite: 1]
* 

#### 2. Universe Class Implementation (C++)

* **Description**: This C++ project implements a `Universe` class, likely for a cellular automaton simulation such as Conway's Game of Life. It includes a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, a destructor, an operator to write `Universe` data to a file, and a function to calculate the number of live neighbors for a given cell, considering both "wrap" and "no wrap" cases. The code defines rules for cell survival, death by isolation or overcrowding, and birth based on the number of live neighbors.
* **Technologies Used**: C++.
* [cite_start]**Files**: `prob12_Traore_Yasmina.cpp` [cite: 2]
